2. Set Up Cron Job (on your server)
To make the Laravel scheduler work, you need to add a single cron job on your server that runs every minute:
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
If you're on Windows (XAMPP), you can use Task Scheduler instead.

4. For Development/Testing
During development, you can manually trigger the command once when needed:
php artisan contract:check
And then process the queued emails:
php artisan queue:work --stop-when-empty
This way, your contract check runs once per day, emails are queued, and the queue worker processes them efficiently.
Would you like me to help you set up any specific part of this configuration?
